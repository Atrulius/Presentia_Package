This is a package for C# Windows Forms

This package helps you use the file extensions:
.ptia (Short for Presentia) and
.ptie (.ptia but E for Editor)

This package has two main namespaces; "Type", and "Convert"

Type is the type of presentia that you want. You can have the editor version,
view only, and you can also have them as they are when they get exported as a file.

Convert lets you convert between different types. So for example, if you want to
export an editor version of the presentation, you can convert from PTIE to PTIA file.
